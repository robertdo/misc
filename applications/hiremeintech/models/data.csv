<p><strong>This position is based in Mountain View, CA.</strong></p>
<h3>The area: Product Management</h3>
<p>One of the many reasons Google consistently brings innovative, world-changing products to market is because of the collaborative work we do in Product Management. With eyes focused squarely on the future, our team works closely with creative and prolific engineers to help design and develop technologies that improve access to the world's information. We're responsible for guiding products throughout the execution cycle, focusing specifically on analyzing, positioning, packaging, promoting and tailoring our solutions to all the markets where Google does business.</p>
<h3>The role: Product Manager, Corporate Engineering</h3>
<p>Google is looking for flexible, results-oriented, and self-motivated technologists to help drive Corporate Engineering's solutions from inception through launch and iterations. Your responsibilities will be to ensure that products launch on time with the best feature set possible. Your goal is to identify innovative technical insights, solicit and prioritize diverse stakeholder requests in the context of our strategy, negotiate conflicting interests, communicate broadly to thousands of internal stakeholders and users, and deliver solutions that exceed expectations. You will need to find ways to minimize the use of traditional packaged server applications through a mix of SaaS services, Cloud-sourcing, and custom internal development on cloud platforms such as Google App Engine. As a first customer of external products that Google is developing, you will provide real-world feedback and share insights about fast, iterative enterprise development. In addition, you will help improve how enterprise applications are developed by identifying and building infrastructure components that Google and other enterprises need in order to deliver solutions and by finding opportunities to transition such infrastructure to products that will be offered externally. As Corporate Engineering’s priorities adapt, you must be willing and able to rapidly switch to whatever product requires Product Management support the most.</p>
<p>Opportunities exist on many systems within Corporate Engineering: Enterprise Application Infrastructure, Sourcing and Recruiting, HR, Payroll, Benefits, Mobility, Workforce Management, Learning and Development, Performance and Compensation, Finance, Reporting, Legal etc.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>Responsibilities:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Build and execute product roadmaps including infrastructure necessary to support our goals that stakeholders endorse</li>
<li>Identify business improvement opportunities, define product vision and strategy, and all elements related to the business case</li>
<li>Initiate and prioritize projects within Engineering, assist in determining the best technical implementation methods as well as a reasonable execution schedule</li>
<li>Break down barriers across groups to launch products and iterate – Product Management, Eng, UI, HR, Customer Support, Finance</li>
<li>Work with Engineering and clients to track and communicate product development, and to develop product launch plans</li>
</ul>
<h4>Requirements:</h4>
<ul>
<li>BA/BS or equivalent in Computer Science or a related engineering field; M.S. or Ph.D. is a plus</li>
<li>At least 5 years of relevant experience building complex mission critical enterprise solutions</li>
<li>Software development experience with a proven track record of product delivery. Accelerate us so we can ship twice as much, twice as fast (requires hands-on leadership)</li>
<li>Domain expertise in one or more business functions supported by Corporate Engineering, such as HR, Payroll, Finance, etc. or with ERP systems is desirable, as is experience with a Cloud offering</li>
<li>Demonstrated ability to gather user requirements across diverse functional areas and convert them into a compelling product vision</li>
<li>Understanding of Cloud/SaaS and web technologies, and willingness to embrace leading edge Google technologies while mitigating schedule risks</li>
<li>Entrepreneurial drive and ability to achieve stretch goals in an innovative and fast paced environment</li>

<h3>The area: Commerce and Local</h3>
<p>There's always more information out there, and often, the information that matters most is what's nearest to you. The Commerce and Local team is made up of our geography and e-commerce experts. When we're not mapping the Amazon rainforest, we're helping you buy a bike, recommending the best slice of pizza within pedaling distance, providing directions on how to get there, and letting you pay for it via your phone. From Google Maps and Google Places to Google Offers and Google Wallet, the Commerce and Local team helps our users navigate the world around them.</p>
<h3>The role: User Experience Design Manager, Payments</h3>
<p>The mantra of the the User Interface (UI) team is: ""Focus on the user and all else will follow."" As a UI Designer, you have a strong technical background and work closely with Engineers and Product Managers to design products that are simple but great for the user, focusing on interaction and visual design.

Your job is to make sure that our products are intuitive, accessible and usable to our millions of users.</p>
<p>As a recognized expert in your field, you use your leadership skills to manage multiple teams and projects across multiple geographies and lead the overall design of a complex and evolving products. You have a major impact and take active role in defining the user experience across major product lines.</p>
<p>The Google Commerce organization is seeking a Design Manager of Payments (and Billing). As mobile, local, and social trends converge in the next chapter of eCommerce, we are looking for an innovative big-thinker, to help us develop and realize a user experience vision for revolutionizing how people shop and pay online and offline. In the past few thousand years, the way we pay has changed just three times—from coins, to paper money, to plastic cards. Now we’re on the brink of the next big shift. Earlier this year, we launched Google Wallet - an application that allows users to pay for day-to-day transactions by tapping a terminal with their phone, instantly redeeming saved offers and coupons. Eventually your loyalty cards, gift cards, receipts, boarding passes, tickets, even your keys will be seamlessly synced to your Google Wallet. And, this is just the beginning of our vision for Payments and Billing. Accordingly, our ideal candidate will be a systems-level design thinker and visionary - with strong user-instincts and outstanding design and brand intuition - who will provide leadership and direction setting to a team of designers, researchers, and prototypers. Their primary objective will be to ensure an unparalleled user experience that enables users (both merchants and consumers) to effortlessly interface with our growing suite of payment/billing instruments in the most elegant, efficient, and enjoyable way possible. We’re looking for someone with an uncanny sense for simplifying complexity, and creating elegant, mainstream presentations of otherwise expansive content and complex workflows. An unfailing capacity to advocate on behalf of our users is a must; the role will significantly influence the experience (and culture) of our rapidly growing user base, by optimizing their ability to sell/purchase products and services in a variety of locations, across a number of device types. Because the scope of the role is likely to extend across a manifold of customer types, devices, and applications, it is critical that the candidate have a strong sense for product branding, and the capacity for reinforcing that brand by enabling it throughout a myriad of user experience touchpoints.</p>
<h4>Responsibilities:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Provide leadership, direction, and mentorship for a multi-disciplinary team of interaction designers, visual designers, and prototypers; lead creative and holistic thinking across diverse product releases, platforms, and devices.</li>
<li>Deliver a UX vision for Payments and Billing, along with a plan for evolutionary, iterative updates, that actualize the larger vision over time , and collaborate with other design leads and managers to architect the integration of Payments into a near and long term UX vision for global Commerce.</li>
<li>Foster Google’s culture and principles within the group, while setting new standards in executional and operational excellence, and build strong relationships and operating rhythms with leaders inside and outside of Payments, to efficiently implement user experiences that are cohesive, inclusive, and well-informed.</li>
<li>Responsibly and effectively advocate for users in a fast-paced, corporate climate, imparting day-to-day design leadership that fosters a shared understanding of the user-centric intersection between design, content, business, and engineering.</li>
<li>Recruit, assess, hire, develop, and retain an organization of outstanding UX personnel.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Minimum Qualifications:</h4>
<ul>
<li>BA or BS in Human-Computer Interaction (In lieu of degree, 4 years of relevant experience).</li>
<li>8+ Years of experience in Interface Design, Interaction Design, or Information Architecture.</li>
<li>3+ years managing or leading teams.</li>
<li>Proven experience designing web and mobile applications, and fluency in best practices for user-centered interface and interaction design.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Preferred Qualifications:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Experience with payment/transactional systems and mobile devices.</li>
<li>A portfolio or work samples showcasing UX prowess, creativity, and depth of thought coupled with a clean design aesthetic; an aptitude and honed intuition for tasteful designs that are visually engaging.</li>
<li>A general knowledge of how design impacts engineering and vice versa, along with a knack for constructing, interactive designs that are technically feasible/prudent, and an innate capacity for simplifying complexity, and converting intimidating UIs and workflows into mainstream, widely-palatable experiences.</li>
<li>Masterful communication, presentation, interpersonal, and analytical skills; the ability to communicate complex interaction concepts clearly and persuasively across different audiences and varying levels of the organization along with a proven effectiveness in working across organizational boundaries to define, manage, and prioritize work.</li>
<li>An innovative spirit and an enduring sense of humor, and the ability to manage ambiguity, work autonomously, and multi-task in an agile environment.</li>

<h3>The area: People Operations</h3>
<p>Great just isn't good enough for our People Operations team (you probably know us better as ""Human Resources'). Made up of equal parts HR professionals, former consultants and analysts, we're the champions of Google's colorful culture. In People Ops, we ""find them, grow them, and keep them"" - we bring the world's most innovative people to Google and provide the programs that help them thrive. Whether recruiting the next great Googler, refining our core programs, developing talent or simply looking for ways to inject some more fun into the lives of our Googlers, we bring a data-driven approach that is reinventing the human resources field.</p>
<h3>The role: Sourcer (Temporary)</h3>

As a sourcer on one of our functional staffing teams, you play the role of detective -- tapping into all kinds of tools and resources to uncover the best untapped talent out there. Once spotted, you engage with these passive candidates, learn about their aspirations and interests and help them connect with roles, projects and opportunities at Google. You are both scrappy and resourceful, are able to listen to what candidates have to say and then and connect them with the Google magic.</p>
<h4>Responsibilities:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Use Boolean search, Google applications, and social networking sites to identify potential candidates.</li>
<li>Identify, contact and interview potential candidates for roles across North American locations.</li>
<li>Develop innovative sourcing strategies and manage recruiting campaigns.</li>
<li>Use the highest level of professionalism when interacting with candidates, peers and hiring managers.</li>
<li>Maintain multiple databases to track a high volume of candidates while maintaining exceptional accuracy and provide analytics support by using advanced formulas to create and update spreadsheets and reports.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Minimum Qualifications:</h4>
<ul>
<li>BA/BS degree (In lieu of degree, 4 years relevant work experience).</li>
<li>2 years of recruiting experience in an agency, a search firm or with equivalent sales experience.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Preferred Qualifications:</h4>

<li>Previous experience at top recruiting agency.</li>
<li>Strong candidate sourcing and networking skills.</li>

<li>Collaborate with other analysts, subject matter experts and decision makers to develop data-driven policies, strategies or decision-support tools to improve the efficiency and responsiveness of Google’s compute infrastructure.</li>
<li>Apply hypothesis-driven problem-solving approaches to strategic decision projects and to initial “discovery” stages of longer-term tool or policy development projects. Collaborate with quantitative analysts to develop more advanced analytical tools and algorithms when appropriate.</li>
<li>Communicate findings to senior management and partner with stakeholders to drive adoption of recommendations, policies or tools.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Minimum Qualifications:</h4>
<ul>
<li>B.S. Computer Science, statistics or related technical field. In lieu of degree, 4 years of relevant experience.</li>
<li>2 years of relevant work experience, including 1 year industry experience or equivalent, applying analytics to solve business problems in analytic consulting or strategy consulting roles.</li>
<li>Strong spreadsheet modeling, financial analysis and data analysis skills. Proficiency in SQL or capability to learn quickly based on experience with databases.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Preferred Qualifications:</h4>
<ul>
<li>M.S. or PhD in operations research, industrial engineering, statistics, computer science or related technical field.</li>
<li>4 years relevant work experience, 2 years industry experience.</li>
<li>Domain expertise in one or both of these areas: supply chain planning and modeling, compute infrastructure technologies or operations.</li>
<li>Breadth in analytics “basics”: spreadsheet modeling; financial and decision analysis; working with large datasets, and basic probability and statistics (e.g., conditional probability, descriptive statistics, basic hypothesis testing, and linear regression models).</li>
<li>Experience leading cross-functional project teams through strong problem-framing and problem-structuring skills, project management skills, and the ability to communicate insights and “so what’s” to highly technical management teams.</li>

<h4>Responsibilities:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Own end-to-end availability and performance of Google's most visible services and properties.</li>
<li>Ensure a great, almost-100% reliable experience for Google users around the globe while simultaneously enabling a rapid pace of innovation and change in the services</li>

<p><strong>This position is based in San Bruno, CA or Mountain View, CA.</strong></p>
<h3>The area: YouTube and Video</h3>
<p>The first video posted on YouTube was a 19-second clip called ""Me at the Zoo."" Today, more than 48 hours of video are uploaded every minute. The YouTube and Video team helps budding filmmakers and musicians build careers, creates products like Google TV and YouTube Live and runs collaborative projects like Life in a Day and the YouTube Symphony Orchestra. We are leading a change in how we entertain, inform and share with one another, whether through cat videos or footage of a revolution in progress.</p>
<h3>The role: Systems Engineer, YouTube</h3>
<p>As a Systems Engineer working on Google's critical production applications and infrastructure, your mission will be to ensure Google is always fast, available, scalable and engineered to withstand unparalleled demand. You will be in the thick of solving the [often unexpected] problems of systems at scale in a way most engineers never experience.</p>
<p>Your scope is from the kernel level to the continent level. This position requires the flexibility and aptitude to zoom in to fine-grained detail, and the agility to zoom right back out and up the stack. Delve into how software performs, packets flow, and hardware and code interact, in support of managing services, steering global traffic and predicting and preventing failures.... all in a day's work.</p>
<p>You will design and develop systems to run Google Search, Gmail, YouTube, Maps, Voice, AppEngine, and more. You'll manage, automate, and make data- based decisions and judgment calls which influence globally distributed applications. You'll own the production services which comprise *.google.com, and critical infrastructure like GFS, BigTable, MapReduce and large- scale 'cloud computing' clusters.</p>
<p>You will also be driving performance and reliability from software and infrastructure at massive scale -- where dealing in petabytes and gigabits and shifting by orders of magnitude is routine. You will tackle challenging, novel situations every day and work with just about every other engineering and operations team at Google. You will be looked upon as an expert and advocate to fellow engineers on making design and reliability trade-offs in running large- scale services and engineering complex systems that fail gracefully and transparently to users.</p>
<p>As a successful candidate for this role you will have strong analytical and troubleshooting skills, fluency in coding and systems design, solid communication skills and a desire to tackle the complex problems of scale which are uniquely Google. We are particularly interested in software engineers familiar with aspects of running web services at scale -- depth in either networking technologies and Unix system calls are strong pluses.</p>
<h4>Responsibilities:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Manage availability, latency, scalability and efficiency of Google services by engineering reliability into software and systems.</li>
<li>Respond to and resolve emergent service problems; write software and build automation to prevent problem recurrence.</li>
<li>Participate in service capacity planning and demand forecasting, software performance analysis and system tuning.</li>
<li>Review and influence ongoing design, architecture, standards and methods for operating services and systems.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Minimum Qualifications:</h4>
<ul>
<li>BA/BS degree in Computer Science or related field (In lieu of degree, 4 years relevant work experience).</li>
<li>3 years of relevant work experience, including with Unix/Linux systems requiring the use of languages like Python, C, C++, Java, Perl, Shell or PHP.</li>
<li>Technical troubleshooting and performance tuning experience.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Preferred Qualifications:</h4>
<ul>
<li>6 years relevant work experience, including in a high-volume or critical production service environment as well as experience leading short projects involving outside teams.</li>
<li>Experience coordinating or leading small cross-team technical projects.</li>
<li>Experience in OSes and systems (e.g. UNIX internals, device drivers, FreeBSD), open source tools (e.g. dtrace, ktrace), web service components (e.g. load balancing, LAMP stack), storage and clustering (e.g. column stores, Hadoop), scripting and programming languages (e.g. Erlang, Lashell, Scala or Scheme).</li>
<li>Knowledge of IP networking, network analysis, performance and application issues using standard tools like tcpdump.</li>
<li>Ability to handle periodic oncall duty as well as out-of-band requests.</li>
<li>Strong written and spoken English language skills.</li>

And, we approach marketing in a way that only Google can--breaking the rules, redefining the medium, making the user the hero, and ultimately, letting the technology speak for itself.</p>
<h3>The role: Marketing Manager, Search Ads</h3>
<p>This role offers the opportunity to work at the forefront of our search advertising business. Your job is to know our advertisers (and agencies), know the products, and connect them. Feature launches and adoption Our ads engineering and product teams are constantly working to develop better features, formats and algorithms that are useful to end users and valuable to advertisers -- large and small. You’ll work across sales, product management, engineering, PR, legal, webmasters, and other Google marketing teams to manage launch communications and drive good adoption of major features. You will be expected to prioritize launches according to business risk and impact. For major features, you’ll be responsible for naming, positioning, and messaging. When needed, you’ll gather research, data and insights to help make good decisions. You’ll push to understand use cases and how well we’re solving a customer’s problem. You’ll create and edit internal documents like positioning and naming briefs and external assets like blog posts and social media, web copy, sales collateral, case studies, demo scripts, videos, and help center content. You’ll think about potential objections and hard questions from critics and help develop the best responses. You’ll think about ways to create interest and demand. In some cases, you’ll plan and lead additional marketing tactics to launch features or drive adoption like direct marketing, online marketing, and event marketing. Above all, you’ll seek out the big gaps in the path to customer adoption and find creative ways to fill them.</p>
<p>You’re good at breaking complex things down and making them simpler. You love finding and sharing good stories. You love a perfect expression. You love analogies. Because it’s not always easy to communicate in ways that are simple, easy to understand, compelling, humble, human, and -- when possible -- interesting and fun. But that’s what we should sound like whenever we can. So you’ll push hard for these ideals in every communication. Making this role a bit more challenging and interesting, our sales and marketing teams are working hard to develop a more integrated approach across our various products, platforms and services with one common aim -- help our customers grow their business. So the strongest candidates will have some awareness of what’s happening in other areas of online marketing like display, video, analytics, social and mobile. You’ll be able to understand and articulate how search advertising and search features help customers achieve their direct response or brand building goals. This role reports to the Head of Search Ads Marketing who is based in Mountain View.</p>
<h4>Responsibilities:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Lead global launches to drive internal and external readiness and successful adoption of search ads and new formats.</li>
<li>Create greater value for our advertisers by developing marketing materials and programs that help them learn about and execute more effectively and profitably.</li>
<li>Develop thought-leadership materials designed to accelerate our advertisers' (and the industry's) sophistication and profits.</li>
<li>Represent the voice of the customer. Fill gaps where we lack good understanding of what customers need or want.</li>
<li>Evangelize our best practices to our customers and our industry peers via events, webinars and other external communications channels.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Minimum Qualifications:</h4>
<ul>
<li>BA/BS degree (In lieu of degree, 4 years relevant work experience).</li>
<li>4 years experience in product marketing, marketing communications, or business-to-business sales.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Preferred Qualifications:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Strong knowledge of online advertising industry.</li>
<li>Outstanding written and verbal communication skills. Ability to make the complex simpler without losing key ideas and messages.</li>
<li>Strong sense of personal initiative.</li>
<li>Creative flair to bring fresh ideas into product positioning and marketing campaigns.</li>
<li>High levels of comfort with ambiguity.</li>
<li>Strong project and budget management skills, preferably in a cross-functional capacity.</li>
