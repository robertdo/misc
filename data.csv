<p><strong>This position is based in Mountain View, CA.</strong></p>
<h3>The area: Product Management</h3>
<p>One of the many reasons Google consistently brings innovative, world-changing products to market is because of the collaborative work we do in Product Management. With eyes focused squarely on the future, our team works closely with creative and prolific engineers to help design and develop technologies that improve access to the world's information. We're responsible for guiding products throughout the execution cycle, focusing specifically on analyzing, positioning, packaging, promoting and tailoring our solutions to all the markets where Google does business.</p>
<h3>The role: Product Manager, Corporate Engineering</h3>
<p>Google is looking for flexible, results-oriented, and self-motivated technologists to help drive Corporate Engineering's solutions from inception through launch and iterations. Your responsibilities will be to ensure that products launch on time with the best feature set possible. Your goal is to identify innovative technical insights, solicit and prioritize diverse stakeholder requests in the context of our strategy, negotiate conflicting interests, communicate broadly to thousands of internal stakeholders and users, and deliver solutions that exceed expectations. You will need to find ways to minimize the use of traditional packaged server applications through a mix of SaaS services, Cloud-sourcing, and custom internal development on cloud platforms such as Google App Engine. As a first customer of external products that Google is developing, you will provide real-world feedback and share insights about fast, iterative enterprise development. In addition, you will help improve how enterprise applications are developed by identifying and building infrastructure components that Google and other enterprises need in order to deliver solutions and by finding opportunities to transition such infrastructure to products that will be offered externally. As Corporate Engineering’s priorities adapt, you must be willing and able to rapidly switch to whatever product requires Product Management support the most.</p>
<p>Opportunities exist on many systems within Corporate Engineering: Enterprise Application Infrastructure, Sourcing and Recruiting, HR, Payroll, Benefits, Mobility, Workforce Management, Learning and Development, Performance and Compensation, Finance, Reporting, Legal etc.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>Responsibilities:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Build and execute product roadmaps including infrastructure necessary to support our goals that stakeholders endorse</li>
<li>Identify business improvement opportunities, define product vision and strategy, and all elements related to the business case</li>
<li>Initiate and prioritize projects within Engineering, assist in determining the best technical implementation methods as well as a reasonable execution schedule</li>
<li>Break down barriers across groups to launch products and iterate – Product Management, Eng, UI, HR, Customer Support, Finance</li>
<li>Work with Engineering and clients to track and communicate product development, and to develop product launch plans</li>
</ul>
<h4>Requirements:</h4>
<ul>
<li>BA/BS or equivalent in Computer Science or a related engineering field; M.S. or Ph.D. is a plus</li>
<li>At least 5 years of relevant experience building complex mission critical enterprise solutions</li>
<li>Software development experience with a proven track record of product delivery. Accelerate us so we can ship twice as much, twice as fast (requires hands-on leadership)</li>
<li>Domain expertise in one or more business functions supported by Corporate Engineering, such as HR, Payroll, Finance, etc. or with ERP systems is desirable, as is experience with a Cloud offering</li>
<li>Demonstrated ability to gather user requirements across diverse functional areas and convert them into a compelling product vision</li>
<li>Understanding of Cloud/SaaS and web technologies, and willingness to embrace leading edge Google technologies while mitigating schedule risks</li>
<li>Entrepreneurial drive and ability to achieve stretch goals in an innovative and fast paced environment</li>

<h3>The area: Commerce and Local</h3>
<p>There's always more information out there, and often, the information that matters most is what's nearest to you. The Commerce and Local team is made up of our geography and e-commerce experts. When we're not mapping the Amazon rainforest, we're helping you buy a bike, recommending the best slice of pizza within pedaling distance, providing directions on how to get there, and letting you pay for it via your phone. From Google Maps and Google Places to Google Offers and Google Wallet, the Commerce and Local team helps our users navigate the world around them.</p>
<h3>The role: User Experience Design Manager, Payments</h3>

<p>As a recognized expert in your field, you use your leadership skills to manage multiple teams and projects across multiple geographies and lead the overall design of a complex and evolving products. You have a major impact and take active role in defining the user experience across major product lines.</p>
<p>The Google Commerce organization is seeking a Design Manager of Payments (and Billing). As mobile, local, and social trends converge in the next chapter of eCommerce, we are looking for an innovative big-thinker, to help us develop and realize a user experience vision for revolutionizing how people shop and pay online and offline. In the past few thousand years, the way we pay has changed just three times—from coins, to paper money, to plastic cards. Now we’re on the brink of the next big shift. Earlier this year, we launched Google Wallet - an application that allows users to pay for day-to-day transactions by tapping a terminal with their phone, instantly redeeming saved offers and coupons. Eventually your loyalty cards, gift cards, receipts, boarding passes, tickets, even your keys will be seamlessly synced to your Google Wallet. And, this is just the beginning of our vision for Payments and Billing. Accordingly, our ideal candidate will be a systems-level design thinker and visionary - with strong user-instincts and outstanding design and brand intuition - who will provide leadership and direction setting to a team of designers, researchers, and prototypers. Their primary objective will be to ensure an unparalleled user experience that enables users (both merchants and consumers) to effortlessly interface with our growing suite of payment/billing instruments in the most elegant, efficient, and enjoyable way possible. We’re looking for someone with an uncanny sense for simplifying complexity, and creating elegant, mainstream presentations of otherwise expansive content and complex workflows. An unfailing capacity to advocate on behalf of our users is a must; the role will significantly influence the experience (and culture) of our rapidly growing user base, by optimizing their ability to sell/purchase products and services in a variety of locations, across a number of device types. Because the scope of the role is likely to extend across a manifold of customer types, devices, and applications, it is critical that the candidate have a strong sense for product branding, and the capacity for reinforcing that brand by enabling it throughout a myriad of user experience touchpoints.</p>
<h4>Responsibilities:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Provide leadership, direction, and mentorship for a multi-disciplinary team of interaction designers, visual designers, and prototypers; lead creative and holistic thinking across diverse product releases, platforms, and devices.</li>
<li>Deliver a UX vision for Payments and Billing, along with a plan for evolutionary, iterative updates, that actualize the larger vision over time , and collaborate with other design leads and managers to architect the integration of Payments into a near and long term UX vision for global Commerce.</li>
<li>Foster Google’s culture and principles within the group, while setting new standards in executional and operational excellence, and build strong relationships and operating rhythms with leaders inside and outside of Payments, to efficiently implement user experiences that are cohesive, inclusive, and well-informed.</li>
<li>Responsibly and effectively advocate for users in a fast-paced, corporate climate, imparting day-to-day design leadership that fosters a shared understanding of the user-centric intersection between design, content, business, and engineering.</li>
<li>Recruit, assess, hire, develop, and retain an organization of outstanding UX personnel.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Minimum Qualifications:</h4>
<ul>
<li>BA or BS in Human-Computer Interaction (In lieu of degree, 4 years of relevant experience).</li>
<li>8+ Years of experience in Interface Design, Interaction Design, or Information Architecture.</li>
<li>3+ years managing or leading teams.</li>
<li>Proven experience designing web and mobile applications, and fluency in best practices for user-centered interface and interaction design.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Preferred Qualifications:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Experience with payment/transactional systems and mobile devices.</li>
<li>A portfolio or work samples showcasing UX prowess, creativity, and depth of thought coupled with a clean design aesthetic; an aptitude and honed intuition for tasteful designs that are visually engaging.</li>
<li>A general knowledge of how design impacts engineering and vice versa, along with a knack for constructing, interactive designs that are technically feasible/prudent, and an innate capacity for simplifying complexity, and converting intimidating UIs and workflows into mainstream, widely-palatable experiences.</li>
<li>Masterful communication, presentation, interpersonal, and analytical skills; the ability to communicate complex interaction concepts clearly and persuasively across different audiences and varying levels of the organization along with a proven effectiveness in working across organizational boundaries to define, manage, and prioritize work.</li>
<li>An innovative spirit and an enduring sense of humor, and the ability to manage ambiguity, work autonomously, and multi-task in an agile environment.</li>

<p><strong>This position is based in Mountain View, CA.</strong></p>
<h3>The area: Technology Infrastructure</h3>
<p>Behind everything our users see online is the architecture built by the Technology Infrastructure team to keep it running. From developing and maintaining our data centers to building the next generation of Google platforms, we make Google's product portfolio possible. We're proud to be our engineers' engineers and love voiding warranties by taking things apart so we can rebuild them. We're always on call to keep our networks up and running, ensuring our users have the best and fastest experience possible.</p>
<h3>The role: Network Analyst, Operations Decision Support</h3>
<p>At Google, data drives all of our decision-making. Quantitative Analysts work all across the organization to help shape Google's business and technical strategies by processing, analyzing and interpreting huge data sets. Using analytical rigor and statistical methods, you mine through data to identify opportunities for Google and our clients to operate more efficiently, from enhancing advertising efficacy to network infrastructure optimization to studying user behavior. As an analyst, you do more than just crunch the numbers. You work with Engineers, Product Managers, Sales Associates and Marketing teams to adjust Google's practices according to your findings. Identifying the problem is only half the job; you also figure out the solution.</p>
<p>As a member of the Operations Decision Support team, you will lead cross-functional projects and drive mission-critical initiatives in the optimization of one of the world's largest and most powerful computing infrastructures. You will work with Engineers, Analysts, Product Managers, and other Network Systems stakeholders to develop data-driven strategies and decision support tools to optimize Google’s network topology and capacity. You will be expected to think critically and strategically about Google as a business and as an operation, and absorb and process insane amounts of technical background on one of the most advanced computational and network infrastructures in the world. You will be expected to be equally comfortable proposing financial strategies to the CFO or discussing with engineers the technical and financial trade-offs involved in hardware design and deployment strategies.</p>
<h4>Responsibilities:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Lead cross-functional projects and long-term analytic development initiatives, managing multiple projects with competing priorities simultaneously.</li>
<li>Engage broadly with the organization to frame, structure and prioritize business problems where analytic projects or tools can have the biggest impact on Google’s network infrastructure.</li>
<li>Collaborate with other analysts, subject matter experts and decision makers to develop data-driven policies, models or decision-support tools to improve the cost and latency of Google’s network infrastructure.</li>
<li>Draw from a breadth of analytical methods to choose the right tool and right level of complexity appropriate to solving the business problem. Develop more advanced analytical tools and algorithms when appropriate.</li>
<li>Communicate findings to senior management and partner with stakeholders to drive adoption of recommendations, policies or tools.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Minimum Qualifications:</h4>
<ul>
<li>M.S. in operations research or related technical field. In lieu of degree, four years of relevant experience.</li>
<li>5 years experience in applying operations research methods to solve business problems in operations or analytic consulting roles.</li>
<li>Proficiency in at least one scripting language like Matlab, R, or Python or a higher level programming language like C++.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Preferred Qualifications:</h4>
<ul>
<li>PhD in operations research or related field.</li>
<li>10 years relevant work experience.</li>
<li>Domain expertise in network systems, and experience with network optimization models.</li>
<li class=""c1"">Breadth in analytics “basics”: spreadsheet modeling; financial analysis; working with large datasets and writing SQL queries to extract and transform data; basic probability and statistics (e.g., conditional probability, descriptive statistics, basic hypothesis testing, and linear regression models).</li>
<li>Breadth in operations research methods relevant to network planning: optimization, simulation, stochastic modeling, and decision analysis.</li>
<li>Experience leading cross-functional project teams through strong problem-framing and problem-structuring skills, project management skills, and the ability to communicate insights and “so what’s” to highly technical management teams.</li>

<p><strong>This position is based in Mountain View, CA.</strong></p>
<h3>The area: Engineering and Operations</h3>
<p>Google is and always will be an engineering company. We hire people with a broad set of technical skills who are ready to tackle some of technology's greatest challenges and make an impact on millions, if not billions, of users. At Google, engineers not only revolutionize search, they routinely work on massive scalability and storage solutions, large-scale applications and entirely new platforms for developers around the world. From AdWords to Chrome, Android to YouTube, Social to Local, Google engineers are changing the world one technological achievement after another.</p>
<h3>The role: Technical Writer, Platform, Google Fiber</h3>
<p>Technical writers take complex information and communicate it clearly, concisely and accurately without relying on technical or corporate jargon to explain what they're trying to say. With a unique cross functional perspective, our team of technical writers are the key link between our engineers, marketing associates, developer advocates and external users and developers who compromise the wide Google ecosystem. As a Technical Writer, you juggle a variety of projects, from reading and writing example code, to updating FAQs, to drafting product announcements. When a new technical challenge rises to forefront, you are there to diffuse it with your clarifying pen (or keyboard, more likely).</p>
<p>As an internal technical writer for Google Fiber, you will write documentation for Google Fiber's new engineering platform. The role requires you to work well with engineers, have a deep understanding of telecommunication and networking equipment, and view problems from both an engineering and user’s perspective. The ideal candidate is a strong writer, has solid analytical and organizational skills and can quickly understand and communicate complex technical information. Most of all, you should be highly motivated and a strong interest in technology, information management, and technical writing.</p>
<h4>Responsibilities:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Write and organize Google's internal engineering documentation and make it accessible and useful to internal users.</li>
<li>Document customer expectations, processes, and software and hardware interfaces, as well as network configurations.</li>
<li>Build tools to improve the process of organizing and generating documentation.</li>
<li>Work with Google engineers and teams to help solve their information problems.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Minimum Qualifications:</h4>
<ul>
<li>BA/BS degree (In lieu of degree, 4 years relevant work experience)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Preferred Qualifications:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Knowledge of network equipment and applications.</li>
<li>Good track record in self managing work and delivering on time.</li>
<li>Ability to quickly learn new technologies and communicate efficiently and effectively to both technical and nontechnical people.</li>
<li>Strong organizational skills.</li>
<li>4 years of technical writing experience and excellent command of English.</li>

<p><strong>This position is based in Mountain View, CA.</strong></p>
<h3>The area: Finance</h3>
<p>The name Google came from ""googol,"" a mathematical term for the number 1 followed by 100 zeros. And nobody at Google loves big numbers like the Finance team. Whether designing processes to support our global businesses, providing forward-thinking analysis or managing our day-to-day balance sheets, our seasoned accounting and finance pros create innovative solutions to a googol of challenges and keep our business on track.</p>
<h3>The role: SEC Reporting and Technical Accounting Analyst</h3>
<p>As Google drives toward audacious goals, we rely on our SEC Reporting and Technical Accounting team to know exactly what that growth looks like. Each month, quarter and year end, the team prepares the release of Google's financial statements to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the public. Through your relationships with various internal sources, you efficiently gather financial information and oversee the process of preparing, reviewing, submitting and distributing the financial reports. But this role calls for more than just knowing the books -- you also provide equity and treasury research and analysis and review necessary statutory reports. You give expert advice to senior management on U.S. GAAP and SEC filings, and work closely with the Investor Relations team on sales and earnings press releases and reports that reach securities analysts, investors and industry groups globally.</p>

<li>Ensure compliance with GAAP and SEC rules and regulations.</li>
<li>Prepare stock-based compensation expense, earnings per share computations and equity roll-forwards.</li>
<li>Perform technical research on complex accounting issues and prepare accounting write-ups.</li>
<li>Execute proper procedures to ensure adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Minimum Qualifications:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Bachelor’s degree in Finance, Accounting or Business or related field. In lieu of degree, 5 years relevant work experience.</li>
<li>CPA/CA.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Preferred Qualifications:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Recent audit experience within professional consulting and/or public multinational companies.</li>
<li>Excellent understanding of GAAP accounting principles with a strong knowledge of SEC reporting regulations; understanding of Oracle systems or other large ERP systems.</li>
<li>Ability to work independently and within a team environment, and to make well-reasoned and timely decisions.</li>
<li>Demonstrable project management skills to establish and meet deadlines.</li>
<li>Excellent oral and written communication and analytical skills.</li>
<li>Excellent interpersonal skills, attention to detail, organized and thorough with the desire for continuous improvement.</li>

And, we approach marketing in a way that only Google can--breaking the rules, redefining the medium, making the user the hero, and ultimately, letting the technology speak for itself.</p>
<h3>The role: Marketing Manager, Search Ads</h3>
<p>This role offers the opportunity to work at the forefront of our search advertising business. Your job is to know our advertisers (and agencies), know the products, and connect them. Feature launches and adoption Our ads engineering and product teams are constantly working to develop better features, formats and algorithms that are useful to end users and valuable to advertisers -- large and small. You’ll work across sales, product management, engineering, PR, legal, webmasters, and other Google marketing teams to manage launch communications and drive good adoption of major features. You will be expected to prioritize launches according to business risk and impact. For major features, you’ll be responsible for naming, positioning, and messaging. When needed, you’ll gather research, data and insights to help make good decisions. You’ll push to understand use cases and how well we’re solving a customer’s problem. You’ll create and edit internal documents like positioning and naming briefs and external assets like blog posts and social media, web copy, sales collateral, case studies, demo scripts, videos, and help center content. You’ll think about potential objections and hard questions from critics and help develop the best responses. You’ll think about ways to create interest and demand. In some cases, you’ll plan and lead additional marketing tactics to launch features or drive adoption like direct marketing, online marketing, and event marketing. Above all, you’ll seek out the big gaps in the path to customer adoption and find creative ways to fill them.</p>
<p>You’re good at breaking complex things down and making them simpler. You love finding and sharing good stories. You love a perfect expression. You love analogies. Because it’s not always easy to communicate in ways that are simple, easy to understand, compelling, humble, human, and -- when possible -- interesting and fun. But that’s what we should sound like whenever we can. So you’ll push hard for these ideals in every communication. Making this role a bit more challenging and interesting, our sales and marketing teams are working hard to develop a more integrated approach across our various products, platforms and services with one common aim -- help our customers grow their business. So the strongest candidates will have some awareness of what’s happening in other areas of online marketing like display, video, analytics, social and mobile. You’ll be able to understand and articulate how search advertising and search features help customers achieve their direct response or brand building goals. This role reports to the Head of Search Ads Marketing who is based in Mountain View.</p>
<h4>Responsibilities:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Lead global launches to drive internal and external readiness and successful adoption of search ads and new formats.</li>
<li>Create greater value for our advertisers by developing marketing materials and programs that help them learn about and execute more effectively and profitably.</li>
<li>Develop thought-leadership materials designed to accelerate our advertisers' (and the industry's) sophistication and profits.</li>
<li>Represent the voice of the customer. Fill gaps where we lack good understanding of what customers need or want.</li>
<li>Evangelize our best practices to our customers and our industry peers via events, webinars and other external communications channels.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Minimum Qualifications:</h4>
<ul>
<li>BA/BS degree (In lieu of degree, 4 years relevant work experience).</li>
<li>4 years experience in product marketing, marketing communications, or business-to-business sales.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Preferred Qualifications:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Strong knowledge of online advertising industry.</li>
<li>Outstanding written and verbal communication skills. Ability to make the complex simpler without losing key ideas and messages.</li>
<li>Strong sense of personal initiative.</li>
<li>Creative flair to bring fresh ideas into product positioning and marketing campaigns.</li>
<li>High levels of comfort with ambiguity.</li>
<li>Strong project and budget management skills, preferably in a cross-functional capacity.</li>

<h3>The area: Marketing</h3>
<p>Know the user. Know the magic. Connect the two. At its core, marketing at Google starts with technology and ends with the user, bringing both together in unconventional ways.
